### Changed

## [v1.2.6]

Note: Versions 1.2.1 through 1.2.5 are identical to v1.2.0; they were version number bumps while we were diagnosing an issue in OpenUPM.

This is the first release of v1.2.0 of Yarn Spinner for Unity as a separate project. Previously, this project's source code was part of the Yarn Spinner repository. Version 1.2.0 of Yarn Spinner contains an identical release to this.
