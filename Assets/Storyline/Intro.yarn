It was dark by the time I arrived to the cabin.
I had almost expected the lights to be on, extending its shine toward me with a comforting warmth.
This time, only shadow shrouded the windows. In a way, that too was comforting.
It meant that this place had been left perfectly undisturbed.
Reaching into my bag, I pulled out a brass key. Thankfully, I'd kept the copy safe through all these years. Could never bring myself to get rid of it.
The reminder of regret was now only fueling a sense of strange satisfaction as I opened up the door after a few hurried jiggles.

"Geez... what a mess."
He had always been a hoarder, so this was to be expected. The main question was whether he'd burned what I was looking for or not.
I moved some of the items strewn on the couch onto a precarious pile on the table and sat down with a huff.
"It's going to take forever to sort through all this, isn't it?"
I briefly considered starting right away, but...
After the effort it took to get here, it would be best to rest.
I'd rather not have my back screaming at me if I happened to pass out on the floor.
Comforted by the fact that I had plenty of time to search, I stepped carefully over the clutter and made my way to bed.

"Huh..."
"It's actually quite decent."
The living room was the victim when it came to being treated as a landfill, it seems.
Twisting a lock of hair as I glanced around, I couldn't help but feel watched.
It was as though a little serpent had twisted itself tightly around my intestines, hissing a tune of unease.
This room, this... home.
Familiar in the best and worst ways.
Hazy, I tentatively lift up the covers and peek underneath.
Nothing.
"..."
A deep breath.
"Good night to me."
