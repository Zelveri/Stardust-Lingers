line:04a0983,"There was a series of small motions. If I didn't know any better, I would have thought it had nodded at me in response.",Meeting,Visitor_Meeting,62

line:0a2c248,"Feeling my heart swell with affection, I wondered why it was so trusting. Actually, bunnies like this don't usually live in the wild, do they?",Meeting,Sharing_Meeting,127
line:0487eff,Perhaps it had been abandoned?,Meeting,Sharing_Meeting,128
line:038aa4f,The thought of dropping such a sweetie out alone in the woods was baffling. Who could do such a thing?,Meeting,Sharing_Meeting,129
