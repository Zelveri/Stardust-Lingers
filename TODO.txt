TODO log of dialogue, with button
    -> options too??

TODO save gamestate
    -> playerprefs for filenames and general settings
    -> access to variable storage / dialogueRunner simply with GameObject.Find("Variable Storage") in save handler? (bc scene not unloaded)

TODO load savegame:
    -> on load click: fade out, load game and fade back in on new gamestate

FIXME log scene zoomed in??

TODO do save laoding script for every gameplay scene! remove BackgroundHandler from DataController

TODO for phone:
    -> on scene switch: synchronize the variable storages or use only the main one
    x -> implement bubble shifting after text finishes
    -> add mask so that bubbles dont leave phonescreen ( unloading necessary? )
    x -> implement side switching for nametag command (should be no problem to use identical commands, is different dialogue runner)
    -> copy transition fadeIn/fadeOut code to new scene for command
    -> implement image messaging ( just show "fullscreen" on phone unitl click? with some border )
    -> advancing button needs design
