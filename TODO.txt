TODO log of dialogue, with button
    -> options too??

TODO save gamestate
    -> playerprefs for filenames and general settings
    -> access to variable storage / dialogueRunner simply with GameObject.Find("Variable Storage") in save handler? (bc scene not unloaded)

BUG game load causes overlapping text
    -> make fade out wait till line finishes ( or do the mouseclick in code )
    -> startdialogue() from new node
