TODO log of dialogue, with button
    -> options too??

TODO save gamestate
    -> playerprefs for filenames and general settings
    -> little loading animation?
    -> access to variable storage / dialogueRunner simply with GameObject.Find("Variable Storage") in save handler? (bc scene not unloaded)

TODO load savegame:
    -> on load click: fade out, load game and fade back in on new gamestate
    -> decouple datacontroller and dialogue runner interface, interface then with runner as prefab

FIXME log scene:
    -> make dialogue invisible
    -> weird zoom??

TODO do save laoding script for every gameplay scene! remove BackgroundHandler from DataController

TODO for phone:
    -> on scene switch: synchronize the variable storages or use only the main one
    x -> implement bubble shifting after text finishes
    x -> add mask so that bubbles dont leave phonescreen ( unloading necessary? )
    x -> implement side switching for nametag command (should be no problem to use identical commands, is different dialogue runner)
    -> copy transition fadeIn/fadeOut code to new scene for command
    x -> implement image messaging ( just show "fullscreen" on phone unitl click? with some border )
    -> advancing button needs design
    x -> DataController insert into LineUpdateHandler Script with DataController.dataController
    -> need to save bubbles, too
    -> adjust Log spacing
