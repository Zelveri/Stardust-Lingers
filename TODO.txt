TODO log of dialogue, with button
    -> options too??

TODO save gamestate
    -> playerprefs for filenames and general settings
    -> access to variable storage / dialogueRunner simply with GameObject.Find("Variable Storage") in save handler? (bc scene not unloaded)

TODO load savegame:
    -> on load click: fade out, load game and fade back in on new gamestate

TODO maybe!! make 'transition Slide' as a setting for 'backdrop' scene switching animation instead of switching itself

FIXME clear text before transitioning!
